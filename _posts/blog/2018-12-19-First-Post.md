Putting together this "website" will be an interesting experience. I've had zero HTML/CSS experience and had just started my python journey three months ago. I also have very rudimentary skills in writing, so I don't expect this website to be a source of great wisdom or knowledge. Rather, I think this will be a great way for me to jot down thoughts so that over time, hopefully, I'll be able to organize my ideas in a more concise and thoughtful way.

Aside from the benefit of helping me internalize the things I'm learning, although I don't seek nor do I expect an audience, I think having this information public is a way for me to ensure I'm accountable for my learning process. To me, constantly learning is what drives curiosity, and curiosity is what drives happiness (and struggle), and we all want happiness (struggle too).

I couldn't recall any inspirational quotes on complacency, so I googled it and clicked on the first link. There were 30 quotes but this one by Franz Kafka stood out to me because not only do I agree with it, but I respect a man who can write about a man turning into a cockroach.

> ❝Always first draw fresh breath after outbursts of vanity and complacency.❞
> ― Franz Kafka

It's not like you can eliminate vanity and/or complacency in your life. Again, it's NOT about eliminating these thoughts. It's about recognizing these thoughts as they arise, experience them for however long is needed, then ultimately moving on. That's my take at least.


To conclude, simply, there's more to learn from having this blog than not having the blog-- so here it begins.
